title: Xenopsd roadmap
layout: default

Nothing is ever perfect; how would we like Xenopsd to change and why?

- light-weight concurrency via Core/Async
- channel-passing rather than fd-passing
- support for libxl-style inter-domain communication channels
- use journalling throughput for restart-ability
